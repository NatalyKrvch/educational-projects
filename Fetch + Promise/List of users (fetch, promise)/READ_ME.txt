Task description: 

Your colleagues have implemented a system that allows you to get a list of users on url: 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
You need to get all users using fetch and add the name of each user to the html element with id  "data-container". 
For convenience, add a span element with the text "Loading..." before loading users, 
and hide this element after loading user data.
The template for the userâ€™s HTML element is as follows:
<li><a href="#">User's name</a></li>

HTML and CSS code are given.
